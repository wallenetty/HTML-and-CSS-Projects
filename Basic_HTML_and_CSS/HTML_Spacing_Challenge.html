        <title>HTML Spacing Challenge</title>
<!-- This is my example of using a <span> tag -->
    <p>
        <h3>Using the < span > tag</span></h3>
        There once was a man named <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold">Jack</span>,<br>
        who met a lady named <span style="color: pink; font-weight: bold">Jill</span>.<br>
        They went up a <span style="color: green; font-weight: bold">hill</span> to fetch some water.<br>
        You know the rest of the story...<br>

<!-- This section is about my cat -->

    <h3>Demonstrating the < section > tag</section></h3>
    <p>Our cat's name was chosen for her tortoiseshell markings.</p>
    <p>My daughter has been interested in Japanese culture and language for some time.</p>
    <p>Our cat's name literally translates into Pacchi = patch, Hime = princess.</p>

<!-- This is an example of using the <&nbsp> Non-Breaking Space character in my code -->
    <h3>Using the non-breaking space character</h3>
    <p>I work Monday through Friday 4:30&nbsp;a.m. to 1:00&nbsp;p.m.</p>
    <p>The non-breaking space character can also add additional spaces into a sentence.</p>
    <p>Here's an example of adding an additional space &nbsp;&nbsp; in &nbsp;between &nbsp; words.</p>

<!-- This is an example of using the copyright symbol-->
    </p>
        <h3>Using the copyright symbol</h3>
        The copyright symbol can be written by it's Entity Name or by it's Entity Number.
        So if I write a sentence using the Entity Name code "&-c-o-p-y-;", it should appear as the &copy; symbol.
        Or you can write a sentence using the Entity Number "&-#-1-6-9-;", it should appear as the &#169; symbol also.
